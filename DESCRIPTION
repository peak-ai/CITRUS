Description: A tool to easily run and visualise supervised and unsupervised state of the art customer segmentation. 
    It is built like a pipeline covering the 3 main steps in a segmentation project: pre-processing, modelling, and plotting.
    Users can either run the pipeline as a whole, or choose to run any one of the three individual steps.
    It is equipped with a supervised option (tree optimisation) and an unsupervised option (k-clustering) as default models.
